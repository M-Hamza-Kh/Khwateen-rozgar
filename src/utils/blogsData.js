        title: "Global Gender Gap: Where Pakistan stands",
        images: [blog_1, blog_2, blog_3, blog_4],
        blogDetail: "Historically, both political and economic theories have ignored the issues of gender division. There are two reasons for this ignorance. First, women and men are so equal in status and role designation that political and economic theories need not distinguish between them. Second, the role of women in the political and economic realm is unimportant and we are safe to ignore them. These two approaches seem inappropriate. We have seen that women are active participants in public life in our societies. \n" +
            "The Global Gender Gap report 2020 issued by the World Economic Forum (WEF) indicates that Pakistan ranked 7th among the regional countries in South Asia.  This means that all other six countries in the region performed well in terms of gender parity. Ranking globally, the global gender gap report further revealed that Pakistan ranked 151 out of 153 countries with accumulative score of 0.564. The global gender gap index uses four indicators including economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, access to health facilities and political participation and empowerment. \n" +
            "Performance on economic participation and opportunity indicators reveals that Pakistan ranked 150 out of 153 countries with a score of 0.327 which is much below the global average of 0.582. In labor force participation rate Pakistan ranked 147 out of 153 countries with a score of 0.298 compare to the global average score of 0.661. Labor force participation data indicates that only 25.2 percent of women are employed compared to male participation rate of 84.5 percent. \n" +
            "\n" +
            "The wage equality for similar work indicates ranked Pakistan 102 out of 153 countries with a score of 0.592 compare to the average score of 0.613. Pakistan ranked 148 out of 153 for estimated earned income and scored very low of 0.181 compare to world average of 0.499. The situation is also grave when we talk about the percentage of legislators, senior officials and managers and Pakistan ranked 146 out of 153 countries. The following graph shows Pakistan’s dismal performance. \n" +
            "\n" +
            "The percentage of professional and technical workers is also show disturbing aspects. The percentage of male worker is 76.7 percent compare to female participation of 23.3 percent. \n" +
            "Now come to the second component of educational attainment. Literacy rate shows that Pakistan ranked 143 out of 153 countries in the list. The percentage of female is 46.5 percent compare to male literacy of 71.1 percent. \n" +
            "\n" +
            " Enrolment in primary education is somehow encouraging. Pakistan scored 0.840 which is greater than the global average of 0.757. \n" +
            "Pakistan ranked 145 when it comes to health and life expectancy. Female are fortunate here by having more average life than male in Pakistan. Analyzing the static on political empowerment, women in parliament is about 20.2 percent compare to their 79.8 percent men in the parliament. Women on the ministerial position is restricted to 12 percent compare to  88 percent male on ministerial positions. \n" +
            "  \n" +
            "\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Now this is high time to build fairer and more inclusive society in terms of gender equality. Instilling gender parity across economic participation, education, health and politics is critical to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGS) of the United Nations Global Agenda 2030. The government should use different indexes like Global Gender Gap (GGG), Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM), Gender Related Development Index (GRDI) and other reports as a compass to track the progress on relative gaps between men and women. The identification of gaps in economic participation, access to health facilities, access to educational opportunities and participation in politics allow the government to set priorities to minimize the gap. \n" +
            "Statistics reveal and suggest growing urgency for government intervention to minimize the gap between men and women. Without the inclusion of half of the population and better integration of the half of Pakistan’s talent, struggling for a more inclusive economy and prosperous society is day dreaming. ",

        images: [blog_1_2, blog_2_2, blog_3_2, blog_4_2],
        blogDetail: "Gender Development Index (GDI) or Gender-related Development Index is introduced in the human development report of the United Nation Development Program (UNDP). Besides GDI, Gender Empowerment Measurement (GEM) index was also used to measured gender inequality. Both GDI and GEM measure gender gaps in the process of human development. The report accounts for disparities between men and women in in three basic dimensions in human development including health, education and standard of living. \n" +
            "\n" +
            "Gender Development Index report is very useful to assess the existing gaps between men and women and help design effective, gender-focused policies to eliminate these gaps. The latest gender development index ranked Pakistan 152 indicating that women are lagging behind their male counterpart in this country. The troubling aspect of the Gender Development Index report is the lower ranking of Pakistan among the regional South Asian countries. HDI value for female indicates that India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Maldives and Bhutan performed better than Pakistan and Afghanistan. Pakistan with HDI value of 0.464 for female is only ahead of Afghanistan with HDI value of 0.411 for female. \n" +
            "\n" +
            " \n" +
            "The further examination of the report reveals that GDI value for Pakistan 0.747 is higher than Afghanistan with the value of 0.723. The rest of the countries including India with a score of 0.829, Bangladesh 0.895, Sri-Lanka 0.938, Nepal 0.897, Bhutan 0.893 and Maldives with a GDI score of 0.939.  \n" +

            "\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Data on female life expectancy in the South Asian countries indicate that Afghanistan ranked at the lowest with average life of 66 years for female followed by Pakistan with 68.1 years. The remaining countries in the gender development index scored greater than Pakistan and Afghanistan. Female life expectancy at the time of birth in India is 70.7, Bangladesh 74.3, Sri-Lanka 80.1, Nepal 71.9, Bhutan 71.8 and female life expectancy at the time of birth in Maldives 80.5.  \n" +
            "\n" +
            "\n" +
            "When it comes to educational attainment for female in the South Asian countries, this is very unfortunate that Pakistan ranked at the lowest. Expected years in school for female in Pakistan is 7.8 years. Afghanistan performed better and the expected years of schooling for female are 7.9 years. India 12.9, Bangladesh 11.6, Sri Lanka 14.2, Nepal 12.7, Bhutan 12.2 and expected years of schooling for female in Maldives is 12.2 years. \n" +
            "\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Policy Options on the Table:\n" +
            "Gender Development Index is an important tool to explore gender gaps in our communities. Data indicates that women are disadvantaged when we talk about economic participation, educational attainment, and access to health facilities. This discrimination or gap is caused by political, social as well as economic factors. Family structure, society, cultural values, schools, prevailing stereotypes about women's productivity and unequal treatment of women by the market are responsible for this widening gap between men and women. \n" +
            "The current roles available to women in the society foster desperation and frustration among women. The development of separate women-centered institutions to create productive opportunities for women is critical. This will increase their financial independency, end patriarchal culture and male domination from the society. Other gender-related reforms include public provision of child-care facilities, nationalized health care, and investment in social infrastructure, day care to increase the chances for women to increase participation and optimize their productivity and government efforts to expand job opportunities for women. Besides government initiatives, private employers should also offer more flexible work schedules, paid leaves for pregnant women and some kind of compensation for absence from work due to parenting. \n" +
            "No one can deny the role of institutions to accommodate the different needs and interests of women. Institutional arrangements and legislations by the government to protect women are critical but oppression of women cannot be eliminated till some fundamental changes occur in the society including changes in the institutions of marriage and family. Restricting ourselves to only legal reforms would not be sufficient to end disparities and liberate women. Genuine gender equality demands genuine freedom. Genuine equality would be attained only when women held equal power and were no longer dependent on men for financial support. Besides institutional arrangements by the government, we also need to dismantle the existing stereotype that women are less productive and are uniquely suited for the roles of care-giver and homemaker.\n" +
            "Denying more than half the population a full opportunity to participate and contribute to economic activity is alarming. We need to make our economy and society more inclusive by increasing women’s participation in the workforce, closing the pay gap between men and women, and helping more women advance into leadership roles.",
